### Project Background
This project examines New York City; bus transportation system to identify
inefficiencies and propose optimization strategies. Using Excel for data cleaning,
analysis, and visualization, the study provides actionable insights into bus delays,
breakdowns, and operational bottlenecks. The goal is to help stakeholders make
data-driven decisions to enhance service reliability and efficiency in one of the
busiest transportation networks in the world.

### Goals and Objectives
1. **Analyze Bus Delays and Breakdowns**: Identify patterns in breakdowns,
delays, and common service disruptions.
2. **Detect Operational Inefficiencies**: Highlight areas with frequent issues or
excessive delays.
3. **Propose Data-Driven Solutions**: Recommend strategies to optimize routes
and improve service quality.
4. **Create User-Friendly Visualizations**: Use Excel to develop clear charts and
pivot tables for actionable insights.

### Analysis Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**:
o Removed incomplete or duplicate records to ensure a consistent
dataset.

o Standardized columns for easier analysis, such as time formats and
route identifiers.


2. **Descriptive Analysis**:
o Calculated summary statistics for delays, breakdown frequencies, and
average service times.

o Grouped data by borough, route, and time of day to detect spatial and
temporal trends.

3. **Trend and Correlation Analysis**:
   
o Investigated the relationship between specific days of the week and the frequency of breakdowns or delays

o Identified recurring breakdown issues linked to specific bus routes or
times.

4. **Visualization**:
Developed charts and pivot tables to showcase:

o Top 10 boro with most delays.

o frequencies for running late and breakdown(weekly).

### Key Insights
1. **Routes with the Most Delays**:
   
o Certain routes consistently experience delays, particularly during peak
hours, suggesting congestion or route inefficiencies.

2. **Borough-Wide Analysis**:
   
o Manhattan and Rockland County report the highest delay rates due to high
traffic density and route overlap.

3. **Breakdown Causes**:
o Mechanical Problem  are the leading cause of breakdowns, followed by
won't start and Flat tire.

### Recommendations
1. **Targeted Route Optimization**:
   
o Redesign routes with high delay frequencies to reduce overlaps and
congestion points.

2. **Preventative Maintenance Programs**:
   
o Introduce regular checks and upgrades for buses prone to mechanical
failures to minimize breakdowns.

o Schedule Maintenance over weekends to help with breakdowns.

3. **Dynamic Scheduling**:
   
o Use real-time traffic data to adjust schedules and allocate additional
buses during peak times to improve service reliability.

4. **Data-Driven Training Programs**:
   
o Train drivers to handle high-traffic conditions and implement incident
response protocols for quick recovery during breakdowns.
